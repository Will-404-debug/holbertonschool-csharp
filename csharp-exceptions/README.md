# 0-safe_list_print

## Description
This project implements a method that prints `n` elements of a list of integers, handling cases where `n` is larger than the number of elements in the list. The method `SafePrint` uses exception handling to ensure that no out-of-range errors are thrown, even if the requested number of elements exceeds the list's size.

### Method Prototype
```csharp
public static int SafePrint(List<int> myList, int n)

### Key Points: 
- The `README.md` provides an overview of what the method does, including how to run and compile the project.
- It specifies the method signature and provides an example output.
- It outlines how to use the project, including installation and running instructions.
- Remember to replace `<repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository when you add this file.
