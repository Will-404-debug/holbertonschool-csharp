# Classes Project

## Description

The **C# Classes** project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on creating and understanding classes in C#. The goal is to build a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by defining classes, namespaces, and their interactions.

This project contains various tasks, each within its own directory. Each task represents a different aspect of class creation and management, such as defining constructors, properties, methods, and handling inheritance in C#. Every task is isolated in its own folder with a `.csproj` file to allow for independent compilation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple folders, with each folder representing a task. Each task has its own class or set of classes, as well as a `README.md` file explaining the purpose of that particular task.
