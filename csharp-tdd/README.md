# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Project

This repository contains a series of tasks demonstrating test-driven development (TDD) principles using C#. Each task is implemented as a separate solution, following best practices for unit testing and code organization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- Each task folder (e.g., `0-add`) contains:
  - A solution file (`.sln`).
  - A class library project (e.g., `MyMath`) that contains the functionality.
  - A test project (e.g., `MyMath.Tests`) that contains unit tests for the library.

## Task Overview

### Task 0: Addition

- **Namespace**: `MyMath`
